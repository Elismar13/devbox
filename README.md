# 🛠️ DevBox

## 📚 Introduction to DevBox

DevBox is a web-based toolbox for developers, providing a suite of useful tools for everyday development tasks. With DevBox, you can easily format JSON, convert text to Base64, and more.

## 🤔 How it Works

DevBox is built as a single-page application (SPA) using React and TypeScript. The application is divided into several tools, each with its own functionality. The tools are designed to be easy to use and provide instant feedback.

## 💻 Technologies

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** None (client-side only)
* **Dependencies:**
	+ `react-i18next` for internationalization
	+ `react-hot-toast` for toast notifications
	+ `codemirror` for code editing
	+ `json-parse-even-better-errors` for JSON parsing

## 📚 Instructions for Local Development

### 📝 Prerequisites

* Node.js (>= 14)
* npm (>= 6) or yarn (>= 1)
* TypeScript (>= 4)

### 🚀 Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/devbox.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### 📦 Building and Deployment

1. Build the application: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
2. Deploy the application to your preferred hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
3. DevBox is hosted on: https://devboxtools.netlify.app/

## 🎉 Features

* **JSON Formatter:** Format JSON data with indentation and syntax highlighting
* **Base64 Converter:** Convert text to Base64 and vice versa
* **Timestamp Converter:** Convert timestamps between different formats
* **Code Editor:** Edit code with syntax highlighting and auto-completion
* **Dark mode:** Dark mode support

## 🚧 Roadmap

+ Use Github actions to deploy to Vercel
+ Add support for more timestamp formats
+ Improve code editor with more features (e.g., code folding, debugging)
+ Add support for more encoding formats (e.g., hexadecimal, binary)
+ Add support for more tools (e.g., a color picker, a font generator)
+ Implement a user authentication system to save user preferences
